# What is Our Project?
We are creating a web app to assist in productivity, and time management of students by creating a competitive environment where they are rewarded for beign more productive than other users.

Users will create timers for tasks they wish to accomplish, and note how long they were productive during their allocated time slot. They are rewarded with points for their active time, and seek to
place as high as possible on the leaderboards.

# Development Info
We will be using the MERN stack to develop our web app (MongoDV, Express.js, React, Node.js) and will be locally hosting it for final usage.

The languages we plan to use are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
